# Competition procedure
The Neural MMO Challenge is an opportunity for researchers and machine learning enthusiasts to test their skills by designing and building agents that can survive and thrive in a massively multiagent environment full of potential adversaries.
In this challenge, you will train your models locally and then upload them to AIcrowd (via git) to be evaluated.
**The following is a high level description of how this process works.**

![WIP]()

1. **Sign up** to join the competition [on the AIcrowd website](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/ijcai-2022-the-neural-mmo-challenge).
2. **Clone** this repo and start developing your solution.
3. **Design and build** your agents that can compete in Neural MMO environment and create your submission as described in [create submission](#2-create-submission) section.
4. [**Submit**](#-submission) your agents to [AIcrowd Gitlab](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com) for evaluation. [Refer this for detailed instructions](#submission).


# üí™ Installation

> We recommend using `python 3.9`. If you are using Miniconda/Anaconda, you can install it using `conda install python=3.9`.


Clone the starter kit repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
# See https://github.com/IJCAI2022-NMMO/ijcai2022nmmo#installation.
$ pip install xxx
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Preparing your submission

### 1. write your agent
We provide a variety of baselines agent, please refer to [`ijcai2022-nmmo-baselines`](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/neural-mmo/ijcai2022-nmmo-baselines) repository.

### 2. create submission

The submission entrypoint is a python script `my-submission/submission.py`, that runs in an environment defined by `Dockerfile`.

You need to copy all your necessary code to `my-submission/` directory**, and replace `submission.py` with you own implementation, which must inherit the [`Team`]() class and have [`act`]() method implemented. An example is provided in `my-submission/submission.py` for your reference.

**Note:** If your agent doesn't inherit the `Team` class, the evaluation will fail.

### 3. validate locally before submit

We have provided `tool.py` to validate your submission locally. This file will execute your submission in the same way as the actual evaluation.

To run the validation locally, run the following command.

```bash
$ python tool.py test --submission=my-submission --remote=docker
```

Make sure you see such log below.
```
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx test pass
```

# üì® Submission

## Repository Structure

**File/Directory** | **Description**
--- | ---
[`my-submission/`](my-submission/) | Directory containing your submission.
[`submission-runtime/`](submission-runtime/) | Directory containing the default dockerfile and requirements.txt. Don't change!
[`submit.sh`](submit.sh) | Helper script to submit your repository to [AIcrowd GitLab](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com).
[`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) | Docker config for your submission. 
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) | File containing the list of python packages you want to install for the submission to run.
[`tool.py`](tool.py) | Hepler script to validate your submission locally. Refer[`validate locally before submit`](#3-validate-locally-before-submit) for more information.

## Runtime configuration
The default runtime is provided in `submission-runtime`. We also accept submissions with custom runtimes, so you can choose your favorite. The configuration files include `requirements.txt` file and `Dockerfile`.


## üöÄ Submitting to AIcrowd

### **Add your SSH key** to AIcrowd GitLab

You can add your SSH Keys to your GitLab account by going to your profile settings [here](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/profile/keys). If you do not have SSH Keys, you will first need to [generate one](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair).


### `aicrowd.json`

Your repository should have an `aicrowd.json` file with following fields:

```json
{
    "challenge_id" : "the-neural-mmo-challenge",
    "authors" : ["Your Name"],
    "description" : "Brief description for your submission"
}
```

This file is used to identify your submission as a part of the Neural MMO Challenge. You must use the `challenge_id` as specified above.

### Configuring the submission repository

```bash
git remote add aicrowd git@gitlab.aicrowd.com:<username>/neural-mmo-starter-kit.git
```

**Note:** This needs to be done only once. This configuration will be saved in your repository for future use.

### Pushing the code to AIcrowd

```bash
./submit.sh "some description"
```

# üìù Submission checklist

- [x] **Accept the challenge rules**. You can do this by going to the [challenge overview page]() and clicking the "Participate" button. You only need to do this once.
- [x] **Create your own submission**. The `submit.sh` will automatically detect large files and add them to git LFS. If you are using the script, please refer to [this post explaining how to add your models](https://discourse.aicrowd.com/t/how-to-upload-large-files-size-to-your-submission/2304).
- [x] **Validate your submission locally** to know that they work as expected. 
- [x] **Update runtime configuration** using `requirements.txt`, and/or `Dockerfile` as necessary. Please make sure that you specified the same package versions that you use locally on your machine.
